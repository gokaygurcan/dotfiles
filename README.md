# dotfiles

My dotfiles and shell scripts.

---

Basically, they are what I use in daily basis. Tried to add a bootstrap.sh file to setup everything at once. 

First, you need to get bootstrap.sh: 
```bash
whet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gokaygurcan/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh
```

Run  
```bash
sudo chmod +x bootstrap.sh
```

first, and then
```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

And wait for it to install/move everything for you.
